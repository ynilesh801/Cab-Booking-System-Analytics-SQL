# 🚕 Cab Booking System (SQL)

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Cab Booking System** is a data analysis project built using **SQL**.  
It explores how structured database design and query-based analysis can generate valuable business insights for a cab service platform — focusing on customers, drivers, bookings, feedback, and revenue trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and booking patterns  
- Evaluate driver performance and trip efficiency  
- Identify peak demand days and popular travel routes  
- Understand cancellation reasons and revenue trends  
- Propose data-driven strategies for business improvement

## 🧩 Database Design
The database includes six key entities:
- **Customers**
- **Drivers**
- **Cabs**
- **Bookings**
- **Trip_Details**
- **Feedback**

Each table is connected through relationships that ensure data integrity and enable multi-dimensional analysis.
